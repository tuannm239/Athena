# Changelog

All notable changes to ATHENA. Format follows Keep a Changelog; versions are
pre-release sprints until Sprint 15 (production readiness).

### Added
- RFC-0020 back end: immutable IR, DAG Decision Graph with deterministic
  execution order and DSL009 cycle guard, compile_rules() pipeline with

  parser (full v2 grammar), immutable AST, extensible property schema over
  the 12 root objects, semantic analyzer with DSL001–DSL015 error codes;
  golden example test; dsl package coverage 99%.

## Sprint 9 — Portfolio Engine (2026-07-16)

### Added
- ALG-007 (RFC-0027 §5): Kelly-based position sizing chain with [0,1]
  factor validation and constraint cap.
- ALG-008 (SPEC-10): deterministic utility-priority allocator enforcing
  position/sector/cash-reserve constraints; PortfolioProposal output with
  violations and explanation.

## Sprint 8 — Risk Engine (2026-07-16)

### Added
- ALG-006 (RFC-0027): volatility/VaR95/CVaR95/drawdown/downside-deviation/
  liquidity calculators (pure Decimal, 252-day lookback), weighted risk
  score with caps, five-level bands, assessment confidence min(1, n/252),
  RiskAssessment/RiskReport builders with risk-budget violation reporting.

## Sprint 7 — Market Regime Engine (2026-07-16)

### Added
- ALG-001 (RFC-0025): deterministic MarketScore, regime classification
  bands, WeightedConsistency × DataCompleteness confidence, MarketContext
  output; MarketRegimeChanged emitted only on regime change; in-memory and
  Redis MarketRepository adapters (SPEC-07 short-lived context).

## Sprint 6 — Probability Engine + Directive intake (2026-07-16)

### Added
- ADR-0006 evidence model across domain/persistence/API (explicit direction,
  reliability, explanation, metadata; migration 0005); RFC-0025/0026/0027;
  companies table + live company profile endpoint; CLAUDE.md regenerated;
  AGENTS.md created; RiskLevel re-banded per RFC-0027.
- Probability Engine (RFC-0026): deterministic Bayesian pipeline with
  freshness/relevance weighting, separate confidence, identity calibration,
  expected utility, ProbabilityReport with mandatory explanation, PE error
  codes, and evaluation over stored decisions.

## Sprint 5 — Knowledge Graph (2026-07-15)

### Added
- Knowledge context (RFC-0019): 10 node types (Evidence added by ADR-0007),
  9 directed relation types validated against the §4 catalogue, mandatory
  edge provenance, cycle control (explicit `allow_cycle` only).
- Deterministic reasoning services: FindNeighbors, FindImpacts,
  FindDependencies, Traverse, shortest path, ExplainRelationship with
  human-readable path rendering.
- Versioned `GraphStore` port + PostgreSQL adjacency implementation
  (ADR-0007): edges carry created/removed version ranges; any historical
  graph version is reconstructable and queryable.
- Migration 0004 (`kg_nodes`, `kg_edges`).

## Sprint 4 — Feature Store & Data Pipeline (2026-07-15)

### Added
- Feature Store context (RFC-0023): `FeatureMetadata` (semver-validated),
  lifecycle Draft→Validated→Published→Deprecated→Archived with publication
  gates (docs, tests, benchmark, owner), `FeatureRegistry` port + SQL
  implementation enforcing published-version immutability, read APIs
  (Get/GetVersion/List/Search), idempotent SPEC-06 factor catalogue seeding
  (26 factors across 7 categories).
- Data Pipeline context (RFC-0024): deterministic stages
  ingest→validate→normalize→quality with quarantine (nulls, duplicate keys,
  future timestamps), quality reports (completeness/accuracy/freshness/
  consistency/uniqueness), DP001–DP005 error codes, record-level lineage,
  `DatasetCatalog` port + SQL implementation, public interfaces RunPipeline/
  ValidateDataset/PublishDataset/RollbackDataset/GenerateQualityReport;
  datasets persist as immutable DuckDB snapshots; failed datasets never
  publish.
- Migration 0003 (`feature_definitions`, `datasets`).

## Sprint 3 — Application layer, auth & REST API (2026-07-15)

### Added
- Application layer: identity use cases (RegisterUser, AuthenticateUser),
  DecisionUseCases (create/get/list/update with lifecycle transitions),
  PortfolioUseCases; hexagonal ports (PasswordHasher, CredentialStore,
  TokenService, EventPublisher).
- JWT authentication (ADR-0009): Argon2id hashing, access/refresh pairs,
  `/api/v1/auth/register|login|refresh`; `password_hash` migration 0002.
- SPEC-08 REST resources: decisions (GET list/id, POST, PATCH), portfolios
  (GET list/id/positions, POST) — protected by bearer auth; standard response
  envelope with request-id middleware; full error-code mapping
  (400/401/404/409/422/501).
- SPEC-08 path alignment: companies, market, backtests routers expose spec
  paths returning 501 until their engines land; non-spec placeholder routers
  removed.
- In-process event bus (ADR-0010); pagination support in repositories.
- CTO audit reports: PROJECT_STATUS, GAP_ANALYSIS, IMPLEMENTATION_BACKLOG,
  ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW v2, CODE_QUALITY_REPORT.

### Changed
- `pyproject`: added `pyjwt`, `argon2-cffi`; B008 lint exemption for FastAPI
  dependency idiom.

## Sprint 2 — Persistence (2026-07-15)

### Added
- SQLAlchemy ORM models for SPEC-07 core tables (`users`, `portfolios`,
  `positions`, `decisions`, `evidence`, `factors`) plus immutable `audit_log`.
- Initial Alembic migration `ec77f528e384`; env wired to `Base.metadata`.
- Repository implementations: `SqlDecisionRepository`, `SqlPortfolioRepository`,
  `SqlUserRepository` (with `UserRepository` interface in the identity domain);
  every Decision/Portfolio mutation writes an audit record.
- `DuckDbSnapshotStore` — immutable, versioned analytical snapshots.
- `RedisCache` — cache + idempotency keys (ephemeral state only).
- Typed `Settings` config; CI workflow (ruff, ruff format, mypy, migrations,
  pytest with PostgreSQL/Redis services, coverage gate ≥ 90%).
- ADR-0005 (decision lifecycle/schema, Risk↔Portfolio contract),
  ADR-0011 (`ruff format` as the Black gate).

### Changed
- Codebase formatted with `ruff format` (style commit `f2f3efc`).
- `pyproject`: added `pyarrow`, `pytest-cov`.

## Sprint 1 — Domain model (2026-07-15, `a68ae33`)
- Canonical domain layer per SPEC-03/04/05/10/11/12; ADR-0004.
- Canonical specification set SPEC-00…12 adopted (`34c5b51`); Phase 1
  architecture review (`6eaefb4`); Phase 2 roadmap (`8bc4eb9`).

## Sprint 0 — Bootstrap (2026-07-14, `49ed73a`)
- Repository structure, uv/pyproject, FastAPI 501 skeleton, Docker,
  Alembic scaffold, pytest/ruff/mypy toolchain.
